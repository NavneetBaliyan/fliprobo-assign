       "'Jesus Christ! Not only does this film reach our expectations as a film, it surpasses them. There are quite a few things I like about this film so this review may take a while to read.\\n\\nFirstly, the Russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the MCU and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomely-handled pivotal moments in the film’s plot. It seems that many of the MCU’s best films are directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and that doesn’t surprise me one bit.\\n\\nCompared to many MCU films, the acting in this film is phenomenal. Everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature. Shout out to Jeremy Renner, who portrays Clint Barton/Hawkeye who’s character really developed into something new and better in this film and I’m looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments.\\n\\nAlan Silvestri is a master of musical score in media. In both Endgame and Infinity War his music adds so much tension to nearly every scene that it appears in. I honestly feel that with his involvement in the MCU, Silvestri has propelled himself to be one of the great film composers with individuals like Hans Zimmer and John Williams.\\n\\nThe action in this film is perfectly balanced with the more down-to-Earth scenes in the film, which I’ll get into later. The climatic battle, in particular, is a masterpiece to behold. Every character in that scene just the amount of screen time they deserve. No one gets too much or too little, in my opinion and this scene should be enough to impress any comic-book fan.\\n\\nThe visuals, as is the case with much of the MCU, is flawless. The attention to detail in such characters as Thanos or Rocket is beautiful and nearly every bit of CGI we get in these films is a bonafide work of art.\\n\\nFinally, the emotional weight in this film is truly stronger than that of any other MCU film by far. It’s unbelievable how it could top Infinity War. The opening scene is pretty well done in the sense that it was genius to make the first scene spectacular.\\n\\nOverall, I’m so happy that the finale to a 22-film story is this film. This film will probably be considered a classic in around a decade’s time. This film never fails to disappoint. Anyone who doesn’t enjoy this film, well, let’s just say that they cannot be called a fan of the MCU.\\n\\nI loved the movie a lot \\nAs I am great fan of marvel\\nAvengers: Endgame\\', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the \\'Avengers\\' franchise is remarkable and doesn\\'t disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released \\'Iron Man\\'. I\\'m damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It\\'s just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climatic battle left me amazed. It\\'s just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humour doesn\\'t look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I\\'ve listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there\\'s no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.\\n\\nThoroughly wrapped up with incredible action, excitement, WOW’moments and humor — Avengers: Endgame delivers on it\\'s promise by providing a truly epic conclusion (in the grandest fashion possible!) to 11 years of Marvel Cinematic Universe awesomeness. This one, indeed felt like an emotional roller-coaster ride, and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved. The Russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really, really high with their final installment. Despite the longsome 3hr length, the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that it\\'s quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second. This is probably one of the most emotional films I\\'ve ever come across (surprisingly!), with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close. Endgame faithfully shines in every department, while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale.\\nAvengers Endgame is the sequel for the popular  The Avengers (2015) and is the 22nd in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Action starts from where Avengers-Infinity War ended. The remaining Avengers after half of all life in the universe was eliminated due to the actions of Thanos (Jos Brolin), try to reunite. When everything looked lost, Scott Lang,aka Ant Man (Paul Rudd) re-energise the avengers.  Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Ant Man join hands once again to launch a final assault. To findout what happens next, enjoy Avengers-End Game on the silver screen. \\n\\nStar Shine \\n\\nAll the characters being super heroes, thrill viewers with their performances and actions. Robert Donwey and Scarlett Johansson standout with their perforamnces. This part had more focus on Chris Evans’s Captain America, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man and Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow. At times even Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner along with Paul Rudd\\'s Ant Man get importance. \\n\\nDirector\\'s Special \\n\\nDirector Anthony Russo,Joe Russo included all elements to attract all sections of movie lovers though mostly Avengers has fan following among children across the world. Apart from the high voltage action associated with avengers, it also showed the emotional exploration of love and loss, honor, family , friendship, and duty. \\n\\nThe story highlighted how one should conduct and deal in with different situations. There is little humor too and the unexpected twists and turns will thrill movie lovers. Though it is tedious to sit through more than three hours without a break, the emotional journey associated with Avengers by viewers for over the years, make them enjoy each and every scene. \\n\\nViewers can appreciate the way director highlighted the coureage,perservance and teamwork but nothing seems realistic when one analyses the between hand-to-hand combat vs. catastrophic, buildings-collapsing type of explosions and also the value of single death which upsets rather than the death of the crowds. \\n\\nStory,screenplay and direction though at times hit the roadblocks and one cannot come to terms with the illogical and unbelievable scenes, overall it is a treat to movie lovers across the world. \\n\\nViewers cannot make head or tail if they are unaware of Avengers and so they should atleast watch MCUs previous instalments Infinity War and Captain America: Civil War to follow the plot. \\n\\n\\nTechnical\\n\\nTechnical and production values are grand. Trent Opaloch cinematography is beautiful and elevated the film to another level with his camera work. The camera angles are excellent creating powerful impact. \\n\\nAlan Silvestri\\'s background score is thumping and made a lasting impression. The background score haunts viewers even after they leave the theatres. \\n\\nEditing of Jeffrey Ford,Matthew Schmidt is good and crispy. However there are few scenes in the film wich dragged the pace of the film testing the patience of the viewers. \\n\\nProduction values are grand. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nFinal Take\\n\\nAvengers gives an amazing and emotional farewell.\\nNothing like the epic Marvel Infinity Saga has ever been attempted in film history, and while it was nearly impossible to pull off a satisfying conclusion which hits nearly every note, Endgame manages that daunting task. \\nThe at times wrenching emotional impact, the at times laugh-out-loud-funny humor, the at times dizzying action all contribute to the success of this spectacular and ultimately cathartic denouement. \\nYes there are plot holes and yes it is as ever difficult to track the many Infinity MacGuffins, their history, powers and location in space and time, and yes in the end it doesn\\'t matter.\\nMinor Complaint #1 - after the huge build-up Captain Marvel\\'s role could have been more featured, her astonishing powers put to more prominent use, but this is ultimately the Avengers story, the balance of hers yet to be told.\\nMinor Complaint #2 - A lot of screen time is spent explaining plot details and the often baffling intricacy of their plans, leaving less room, with the notable exceptions of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, for the usual solid character development which is at the heart of each of these films.\\nAs an all-too grown man raised on a steady diet of intelligently written, brilliantly drawn comic books about articulate, very human, heroes with extraordinary powers engaged in fantastic tales, it\\'s one of the great satisfactions of my adulthood to see these characters brought to vivid life through the astonishing power of film technology, which has made anything possible.\\nI look forward to what\\'s next - Marvel is in good hands.\\nWas this review helpful to you?\\nI know I said no more surprises, but... I was really hoping to pull off one last one.”\\n\\nAfter the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘Infinity War’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. Heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done.\\n\\nWe’re in the Endgame now.\\n\\n‘Avengers: Endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. For a movie that’s three hours long, not once did I feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). There\\'s so much going on. The fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. It all began when a cocky billionaire escaped a cave with a box of scraps, becoming Iron Man. Then we followed the powerful but arrogant god who has to learn to be worthy of being named “The God of Thunder”. And finally the first avenger, a man lost in time, but holds his pride strong in good nature.\\n\\nFrom start till finish I hooked, especially the opening scene which I knew what was coming, but wasn’t expecting the devastation.\\n\\nThe Russo Brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and I mean every character. I think Black Widow is best handled whenever the Russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. I’m also thrilled Hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps Jeremy Renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times.\\n\\nSame thing with Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-man. It’s incredibly transparent that the Russo Brothers really like this character and doesn\\'t dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. They understand his intelligent and used Scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. He basically saves the world (besides the rat).\\n\\nHeck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even Thor, which I don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. While still having a comedic charm from ‘Thor: Ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. He really is the strongest and most tragic Avenger. The other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs.\\n\\nAlso the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. Chris Evans really grew into the role of Captain America and I can\\'t imagine any other actor playing the part than him. Karen Gillan is often overlooked playing Nebula, as I always thought she nails every role she plays. Despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. What\\'s more to say about these actors than best casting ever.\\n\\nThe mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “Infinity War” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. Still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. Josh Brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. Thanos is this generation’s Darth Vader.\\n\\nThe action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘Infinity War’. If I have to be honest, I shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. Although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but I was never bored during the more slow paced moments\\nThe entire mcu timeline consisting of 22 movies led up to this once-in-a-lifetime event. Avengers Endgame blew me away, as I am a huge fan of the marvel franchise. If you thought that Infinity War  was the one to watch, you\\'ll think differently after watching Endgame.\\n\\nTHE RUSSO BROTHERS CONTINUE TO AMAZE!!\\nThank God these two direct the movies because everything they add to them, makes every movie worthwhile. The suspense is phenomenal!\\n\\nThrilling and jaw-dropping to watch!\\n\\nThe tremendous cliffhanger at the end of infinity war left fans tense to found out what happens next. A year later we\\'re in the Endgame, and oh my wasn\\'t it worth the wait.\\n\\nThe sequence the movie entailed was amazing, including how they introduced captain marvel in the post-credit scene of her debut movie a month before.\\n\\nAlso, I give thanks to the Russo brothers yet again for displaying a congratulative conclusion to an unforgettable journey through the saga. This latest movie is light years greater than infinity war because one movie after another advances and advances, which is the most stunning thing in a franchise you have spent your entire life waiting for.\\n\\nThe mad titan, Thanos, doesn\\'t appear in many scenes as infinity war, but his gladiatorial brawl and unquestionable strength makes up for that as he can no doubt take on the avengers with or without the gauntlet. Josh Brolin is the perfect actor for the role, nobody could\\'ve done a better job at portraying the character as he did.\\n\\nThe masses of Avengers hoping to defeat thanos make an unmisstakeable team in this movie, as they all come together at the end to hopefully complete their conquest and override thanos. The actors and actresses that mimick these superheroes give the movies added entertainment on-set and off-set, as they do their best to fit the characteristics and personality of the characters in Stan Lee\\'s comics.\\n\\nAvengers Endgame is the fourth installment to the Avengers movies and it sure is the one to watch because everything you see in the other three as well as the stand alone solo movies sequence together to show the characters backstories individually and they ultimately form the team of earth\\'s mightiest heroes in the movies that feature all of them as one unstoppable force.\\n\\nI give credit to the founder of marvel studios, Stan Lee, as he was the one who invented the comics and portrayed them in the timeline of events leading to Avengers Endgame as the conclusion to an unmissable chain of events in the marvel cinematic universe.\\n** spoilers alert *** Avengers: Endgame in one word simply fantastic!!!!!!!!!!. I am a massive marvel fan. Have seen every single marvel cinematic universe film release ever since it all really kicked off with the first iron man back in 2008 (the mind boggles this was over 10 years ago). I had very high expectations going into this film and I was not disappointed. The amount of humour moments was a surprise but very welcome. The action (especially the massive battle between thanos army and the returning heroes) was truly grandiose. The moment the heores all return starting with black panther was just very very cool! (Look who isnt so smug now). \\n\\nSorry any black widow fans but the really standout emotional moment of the film for me had to be Tony Stark\\'s fittingly heroic exit. (It was right he is the one who finally outsmarts thanos - played brilliantly by Josh Brolin across both films). \\n\\nRobert Downey Jr had played Iron Man so well in so many of the films prior to this it was always going to be really hard to say goodbye to his character. Captain America Steve Rodgers passing on the mantle was also fitting - finally taking iron man advice (if you\\'ve seen the film you\\'ll know what I mean). \\n\\nThe big battle for me topped the wakanda battle of the last film. It would so good that much more of the heroes got a chance to shine.\\n\\nI have to also say a very emotional film. I can hear your comments already - come on your having a laugh it\\'s a film about superheroes. This film was steeped in emotion - everyone can relate to love and loss. By the directors showing our heroes in a very human way, showing there vulnerabilities as well there strengths as heores it gave the film much gravitas. Extremely fitting for a story that been developed for over 10 years. I would go as far as to say this film is should go down as a landmark in films history and it deserves to make mega amounts of money which is absolutely guaranteed. I will be going to see it again - a second viewing is a must I think. \\n\\n I don\\'t know if the films will be as good going forward if indeed Brie Larson\\'s Captain Marvel becomes the new focial point going forward. Absolutely nothing against strong female lead roles. I like who they\\'re got to play the part. However the character seems almost too powerful - taking out another warship single handedly. Why would she need the avengers help?\\n\\nThe message to all film fans - go see this film then go see it again!!!!!! Absolutely the most satisfying film I have seen at the cinema in a long while ( I go to the cinema a lot).\\nThis movie is one of the best I\\'ve ever seen. To see all 23 movies (i believe) combined into one with the perfect amount of focus on each character was honestly unbelievable and i don\\'t know how they managed to create such a good film. My favourite part BY FAR was the battle scene where all the women teamed up and fought, it was honestly so incredibly empowering and it reminded me about what The Avengers were truly about, fighting injustice and encouraging empowerment whether that be in the other heroes or even in regular citizens who have been affected by the snap. I also want to add that they covered the vanish of 4 billion or-so people SO WELL, to see the city of San Francisco majority abandoned with the empty citi bank stadium and cars strewn and deteriorated after 5 years really set the mood for the direness of the situation and how depressing it was for the people who survived the snap. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!\\n\\nThere was an idea… To bring together a group of remarkable people… To see if we could become something more… So when they needed us… we could fight the battles… that they never could… It was called ‘The Avengers Initiative’… It was a statement, a promise, that if we could not protect the world… be damn sure we would avenge it… \\n# THE FOLLOWING ARE MY PERSONAL VIEWS AND FEELINGS REGARDING AVENGERS : ENDGAME WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP AS SPOILER FREE AS POSSIBLE #\\nIn 2008, we all embarked on a journey of fantasy and adventure that would redefine the ‘super-hero movie’ genre, build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by Maestros like Stan Lee, and would culminate to provide what we now know as ‘The Infinity Saga’ of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\\nAfter the devastating snap called ‘Decimation’ that Thanos did in Avengers : Infinity War, half the life in the Universe is turned to dust, the world is in shackles, and our heroes are left defeated and devastated. But as It’s suggest, some people move on… but not them! Thus, the Avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen. Will they succeed? That’s what this movie is about. \\n‘Avengers : Endgame’ is an epic, marvelous, emotional, and hard yet heart-warming conclusion to The Infinity SAGA. The credit of making this mind blowing film goes to the makers of the film (Directors - Anthony and Joe Russo, Writers - Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Producer – Kevin Feige, Cinematographer – Trent Opaloch, And Editors – Jeffery Ford and Matthew Schmidt), the Actors (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Bradley Cooper, Dana Gurira, and Brie Larson), And the Music Composer – Alan Sylvestri, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, and to all the other cast and crew who have been working in the MCU films since 2008. A well written and crisp script, a very well crafted character development, bonds and relations between those characters, the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics, action, and Science Fiction Stuff! There is a well maintained balance between action and emotion. The movie provides an emotional roller-coaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness, happiness, hope, surprise, apprehension, disbelief, shock, humor, and keeps you on the edge. You laugh heartily, applaud with enthusiasm, and also sob in sorrow. It’s also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments. \\nFinally when the  move ends, what you get is a satisfying, and poetic conclusion to the journey which began 11 years ago.\\nAvengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever made. Yes, I enjoyed endgame more than Infinity war, Into the spider verse, Batman Begins, and Dark knight rises. Even though movies like Infinity war had more action and more battles between the heroes and the villains, endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel boring but also doesn\\'t overload you with endless action sequences without focusing on a coherent story. It was the perfect follow up to the events at the end of Infinity war where for the first time the heroes do not win. While I find the concept of time travel and parallel universes presented within endgame to be complicated and a bit confusing at times, (and yes I know that according to the comics that infinity stones only work within their own dimension, and thus taking an infinity stone from one universe will not make it work in another universe), I really enjoyed how the whole time travel heist allowed each of our main characters to reconnect with their family/relatives who have passed away. Thor reconnects with his mother. Ironman meets his father. Captain America meets his former girlfriend from WW2. And on top of all that, we get to see how each one of these characters have evolved compared to how they were at the start of the MCU. Captain America would have used brute force to achieve his goals in 2012-2014 but the 2023 captain America would now use non-violent and more clever means of achieving the same goal(s). One thing I didn\\'t like about the movie was how they killed off Thanos early on only to bring back an earlier version of Thanos for the final battle. To be honest, I actually liked the Infinity War Thanos more as a villain as he was more relatable and had clear goals whereas the Endgame Thanos was more of a brute force generic villain who just wanted to kill whoever he can get his hands on. But regardless, Josh Brolin played the role so well that most people just remember him as Thanos and Endgame was no exception. I\\'ll give this film a 9.5/10\\nHonestly i could not be happier with the outcomes of this movie, now sorry for saying this but this review will contain spoilers. Seeing some of my favourite MCU characters come to an end including Thanos was a real depressing moment, and left me and everyone feeling a bit unfilled, not because the movie didnt exceed expectations.....its because the movie left of with nothing regarding the future of the MCU. Yes Thor is seen with the Guardians Of The Galaxy, but we knew that the Guardians have an upcoming sequel and to be honest, the Avengers are the pinacle of hype and excitment towards the MCU, and with 3 of the 6 \"OG\" avengers actually dying them being Iron Man \"Tony Stark\",Captain America\"Steve Rogers\" and Black Widow \"Natasha Romenoff\" it left the audience feeling sustained but still hungry for some more footage or any grasp of seeing the Main Avengers. We still do have many more movies regarding other characters such as Spiderman, Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy but i still will never be even close to Excited and Hyped to see those movies as much as Avengers Endgame. I also wanted to complement the screentime of alot of our characters, the Russo Brothers did this so perfectly and i believe that they should be in charge of alot more of the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Regarding other Hated/Less Loved characters such as Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange, im glad they didnt give much screentime because i dont think anyone genuinlly likes seeing these guys hog up any of the 3 hours that the movie was and im happy to see that her power wasnt enough to even fuss Thanos. Overall i would give this movie a 10/10, its excellent and well blended together and every moment of the 3 hours that i watched the movie was just so amazing,not to mention the pure atmosphere of the Cinema at the time was just so heartwarming, and i thank everyone that has ever been involved with the MCU for making a brilliant and interesting franchise that has made peoples childhood such a memorable phenomenom. Stan Lee you are an amazing and creative man, you\\'ll be remembered as such a legend and i hope every moment of your life was as amazing as you made mine when i watched the ending to the worlds most beloved franchise R.I.P.\\n\\nI grew up with these superheroes. Iron Man seemed like such a foreign and interesting concept as a superhero, with me only knowing of dynamic heroes like Superman. \\n\\nAnd as a girl, I never thought I would be interested in this kind of stuff, that I would be captivated by such a intricate and action packed world. But the Marvel Cinematic Universe is for all ages, and both genders. \\n\\nI\\'ve never loved characters this much before. I\\'ve never anticipated a movie as much as this one. I\\'ve never cried so much in a movie. (A good idea to bring my Spiderman tissues into the theater, I tell you.)\\n\\nIt enraptures you and makes you want more, but still remain satisfied with the ending. Captain America is my favorite Avenger, and the ending he got was more than I could ever ask for. \\n\\nThis WHOLE movie was more than I could ever ask for. It was humorous, unpredictable, tear jerking. and grasping your sister\\'s arm because you\\'re so tense. \\n\\nThis may be the end to a decade of story telling, but I will forever be able to say that I saw Avengers: Endgame in theaters. I will be able to say that I watched this story weave together into a phenomenal finale. \\n\\nSo I thank the Russo Brothers, and every single actor that starred in this movie. I am forever grateful to you for giving me the best childhood I could ever ask for. I fell in love with some of the most amazing fictional characters in any universe. \\n\\nNo other movie can top this one, and I am totally okay with that.\\nIt was pretty boring at least for the first half. There was a lot of catch up for the course of the 5 years that had passed but it was more than was needed to move the story forward.\\nIt was too easy to kill Thanos. I realize that killing him was an integral part of the storyline but once they found it, it was over in seconds. Kind of anti-climactic. I know that was the point but that part of the story fell really flat.\\nThey made a mockery of Thor. Yes, I know it was for comic relief but the joke carried on way too long. Thor didn’t seem dark and depressed. He seemed lazy. I think they could have lightened things up without making him such a joke.\\nAnt-Man was an idiot. They did this in Ant-Man and the Wasp and I had the same complaint. If anyone recalls from the original movie, Scott Lang was an electrical engineer who probably knows enough to base his understanding of time travel on something other than Back to the Future.\\nSince when is Pepper the Ironwoman? When the Avengers assembled (that was actually a fun moment), was anyone else surprised to see her show up to do battle?\\nWhy was Captain Marvel there? She shows up (and not in the manner we see in the trailers) to save Tony Stark and help find Thanos. Once he’s dead, she says kthxbye because she has other planets to save in the universe. When she does reappear, she fists her way through Thanos’ spaceship and yet somehow just can’t seem to get a good punch in.\\nWhy was it so easy for Thanos to do the snap in the first place? Maybe I just don’t understand the power of the Infinity Stones but he didn’t seem to have any trouble wielding the power but Hulk could barely handle it and, well, we know what happened to Tony.\\nWHY COULDN’T ANYONE KILL THANOS? In Infinity War, he was powerful because he has so many of the stones. In Endgame, he’s just a bad guy and a warrior. Arguably, he was never a power-hungry bad guy. He was focused on achieving balance in the universe. So the version of the Thanos from the past didn’t quite work for me. With all of them and one of him (without any Infinity Stones), it seems like he could have been defeated.'"

       "'jesus christ! not only does this film reach our expectations as a film, it surpasses them. there are quite a few things i like about this film so this review may take a while to read.\\n\\nfirstly, the russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the mcu and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomely-handled pivotal moments in the film’s plot. it seems that many of the mcu’s best films are directed by anthony and joe russo and that doesn’t surprise me one bit.\\n\\ncompared to many mcu films, the acting in this film is phenomenal. everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature. shout out to jeremy renner, who portrays clint barton/hawkeye who’s character really developed into something new and better in this film and i’m looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments.\\n\\nalan silvestri is a master of musical score in media. in both endgame and infinity war his music adds so much tension to nearly every scene that it appears in. i honestly feel that with his involvement in the mcu, silvestri has propelled himself to be one of the great film composers with individuals like hans zimmer and john williams.\\n\\nthe action in this film is perfectly balanced with the more down-to-earth scenes in the film, which i’ll get into later. the climatic battle, in particular, is a masterpiece to behold. every character in that scene just the amount of screen time they deserve. no one gets too much or too little, in my opinion and this scene should be enough to impress any comic-book fan.\\n\\nthe visuals, as is the case with much of the mcu, is flawless. the attention to detail in such characters as thanos or rocket is beautiful and nearly every bit of cgi we get in these films is a bonafide work of art.\\n\\nfinally, the emotional weight in this film is truly stronger than that of any other mcu film by far. it’s unbelievable how it could top infinity war. the opening scene is pretty well done in the sense that it was genius to make the first scene spectacular.\\n\\noverall, i’m so happy that the finale to a 22-film story is this film. this film will probably be considered a classic in around a decade’s time. this film never fails to disappoint. anyone who doesn’t enjoy this film, well, let’s just say that they cannot be called a fan of the mcu.\\n\\ni loved the movie a lot \\nas i am great fan of marvel\\navengers: endgame\\', which marks the end of the infinity saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. the last film of the \\'avengers\\' franchise is remarkable and doesn\\'t disappoint. watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released \\'iron man\\'. i\\'m damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. the directors, anthony and joe russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. the film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. the biggest strength of the film is the emotions. this is the most emotional superhero film i have ever seen. it\\'s just perfect. the action sequences were jaw-dropping. the climatic battle left me amazed. it\\'s just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. the visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. the humour doesn\\'t look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. the plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. the film features many cameos of characters from the previous mcu films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. the background score gives me goosebumps, though i\\'ve listened to it several times. it was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the hulk. i enjoyed that a lot. but the show-stealer is robert downey jr, who plays the role of tony stark/iron man. the man who started it all proves yet again that there\\'s no one else who can perfect his role. do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.\\n\\nthoroughly wrapped up with incredible action, excitement, wow’moments and humor — avengers: endgame delivers on it\\'s promise by providing a truly epic conclusion (in the grandest fashion possible!) to 11 years of marvel cinematic universe awesomeness. this one, indeed felt like an emotional roller-coaster ride, and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved. the russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really, really high with their final installment. despite the longsome 3hr length, the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that it\\'s quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second. this is probably one of the most emotional films i\\'ve ever come across (surprisingly!), with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close. endgame faithfully shines in every department, while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale.\\navengers endgame is the sequel for the popular  the avengers (2015) and is the 22nd in the  marvel cinematic universe (mcu). action starts from where avengers-infinity war ended. the remaining avengers after half of all life in the universe was eliminated due to the actions of thanos (jos brolin), try to reunite. when everything looked lost, scott lang,aka ant man (paul rudd) re-energise the avengers.  iron man (robert downey jr.), thor (chris hemsworth), captain america (chris evans), black widow (scarlett johansson), the hulk (mark ruffalo), rocket (bradley cooper), nebula (karen gillan), hawkeye (jeremy renner) and ant man join hands once again to launch a final assault. to findout what happens next, enjoy avengers-end game on the silver screen. \\n\\nstar shine \\n\\nall the characters being super heroes, thrill viewers with their performances and actions. robert donwey and scarlett johansson standout with their perforamnces. this part had more focus on chris evans’s captain america, chris hemsworth’s thor, robert downey jr.’s iron man and scarlett johansson’s black widow. at times even mark ruffalo and jeremy renner along with paul rudd\\'s ant man get importance. \\n\\ndirector\\'s special \\n\\ndirector anthony russo,joe russo included all elements to attract all sections of movie lovers though mostly avengers has fan following among children across the world. apart from the high voltage action associated with avengers, it also showed the emotional exploration of love and loss, honor, family , friendship, and duty. \\n\\nthe story highlighted how one should conduct and deal in with different situations. there is little humor too and the unexpected twists and turns will thrill movie lovers. though it is tedious to sit through more than three hours without a break, the emotional journey associated with avengers by viewers for over the years, make them enjoy each and every scene. \\n\\nviewers can appreciate the way director highlighted the coureage,perservance and teamwork but nothing seems realistic when one analyses the between hand-to-hand combat vs. catastrophic, buildings-collapsing type of explosions and also the value of single death which upsets rather than the death of the crowds. \\n\\nstory,screenplay and direction though at times hit the roadblocks and one cannot come to terms with the illogical and unbelievable scenes, overall it is a treat to movie lovers across the world. \\n\\nviewers cannot make head or tail if they are unaware of avengers and so they should atleast watch mcus previous instalments infinity war and captain america: civil war to follow the plot. \\n\\n\\ntechnical\\n\\ntechnical and production values are grand. trent opaloch cinematography is beautiful and elevated the film to another level with his camera work. the camera angles are excellent creating powerful impact. \\n\\nalan silvestri\\'s background score is thumping and made a lasting impression. the background score haunts viewers even after they leave the theatres. \\n\\nediting of jeffrey ford,matthew schmidt is good and crispy. however there are few scenes in the film wich dragged the pace of the film testing the patience of the viewers. \\n\\nproduction values are grand. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nfinal take\\n\\navengers gives an amazing and emotional farewell.\\nnothing like the epic marvel infinity saga has ever been attempted in film history, and while it was nearly impossible to pull off a satisfying conclusion which hits nearly every note, endgame manages that daunting task. \\nthe at times wrenching emotional impact, the at times laugh-out-loud-funny humor, the at times dizzying action all contribute to the success of this spectacular and ultimately cathartic denouement. \\nyes there are plot holes and yes it is as ever difficult to track the many infinity macguffins, their history, powers and location in space and time, and yes in the end it doesn\\'t matter.\\nminor complaint #1 - after the huge build-up captain marvel\\'s role could have been more featured, her astonishing powers put to more prominent use, but this is ultimately the avengers story, the balance of hers yet to be told.\\nminor complaint #2 - a lot of screen time is spent explaining plot details and the often baffling intricacy of their plans, leaving less room, with the notable exceptions of tony stark and steve rogers, for the usual solid character development which is at the heart of each of these films.\\nas an all-too grown man raised on a steady diet of intelligently written, brilliantly drawn comic books about articulate, very human, heroes with extraordinary powers engaged in fantastic tales, it\\'s one of the great satisfactions of my adulthood to see these characters brought to vivid life through the astonishing power of film technology, which has made anything possible.\\ni look forward to what\\'s next - marvel is in good hands.\\nwas this review helpful to you?\\ni know i said no more surprises, but... i was really hoping to pull off one last one.”\\n\\nafter the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘infinity war’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done.\\n\\nwe’re in the endgame now.\\n\\n‘avengers: endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. for a movie that’s three hours long, not once did i feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). there\\'s so much going on. the fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. it all began when a cocky billionaire escaped a cave with a box of scraps, becoming iron man. then we followed the powerful but arrogant god who has to learn to be worthy of being named “the god of thunder”. and finally the first avenger, a man lost in time, but holds his pride strong in good nature.\\n\\nfrom start till finish i hooked, especially the opening scene which i knew what was coming, but wasn’t expecting the devastation.\\n\\nthe russo brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and i mean every character. i think black widow is best handled whenever the russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. i’m also thrilled hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps jeremy renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times.\\n\\nsame thing with paul rudd as scott lang/ant-man. it’s incredibly transparent that the russo brothers really like this character and doesn\\'t dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. they understand his intelligent and used scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. he basically saves the world (besides the rat).\\n\\nheck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even thor, which i don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. while still having a comedic charm from ‘thor: ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. he really is the strongest and most tragic avenger. the other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs.\\n\\nalso the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. robert downey jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. chris evans really grew into the role of captain america and i can\\'t imagine any other actor playing the part than him. karen gillan is often overlooked playing nebula, as i always thought she nails every role she plays. despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. what\\'s more to say about these actors than best casting ever.\\n\\nthe mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “infinity war” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. josh brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. thanos is this generation’s darth vader.\\n\\nthe action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘infinity war’. if i have to be honest, i shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but i was never bored during the more slow paced moments\\nthe entire mcu timeline consisting of 22 movies led up to this once-in-a-lifetime event. avengers endgame blew me away, as i am a huge fan of the marvel franchise. if you thought that infinity war  was the one to watch, you\\'ll think differently after watching endgame.\\n\\nthe russo brothers continue to amaze!!\\nthank god these two direct the movies because everything they add to them, makes every movie worthwhile. the suspense is phenomenal!\\n\\nthrilling and jaw-dropping to watch!\\n\\nthe tremendous cliffhanger at the end of infinity war left fans tense to found out what happens next. a year later we\\'re in the endgame, and oh my wasn\\'t it worth the wait.\\n\\nthe sequence the movie entailed was amazing, including how they introduced captain marvel in the post-credit scene of her debut movie a month before.\\n\\nalso, i give thanks to the russo brothers yet again for displaying a congratulative conclusion to an unforgettable journey through the saga. this latest movie is light years greater than infinity war because one movie after another advances and advances, which is the most stunning thing in a franchise you have spent your entire life waiting for.\\n\\nthe mad titan, thanos, doesn\\'t appear in many scenes as infinity war, but his gladiatorial brawl and unquestionable strength makes up for that as he can no doubt take on the avengers with or without the gauntlet. josh brolin is the perfect actor for the role, nobody could\\'ve done a better job at portraying the character as he did.\\n\\nthe masses of avengers hoping to defeat thanos make an unmisstakeable team in this movie, as they all come together at the end to hopefully complete their conquest and override thanos. the actors and actresses that mimick these superheroes give the movies added entertainment on-set and off-set, as they do their best to fit the characteristics and personality of the characters in stan lee\\'s comics.\\n\\navengers endgame is the fourth installment to the avengers movies and it sure is the one to watch because everything you see in the other three as well as the stand alone solo movies sequence together to show the characters backstories individually and they ultimately form the team of earth\\'s mightiest heroes in the movies that feature all of them as one unstoppable force.\\n\\ni give credit to the founder of marvel studios, stan lee, as he was the one who invented the comics and portrayed them in the timeline of events leading to avengers endgame as the conclusion to an unmissable chain of events in the marvel cinematic universe.\\n** spoilers alert *** avengers: endgame in one word simply fantastic!!!!!!!!!!. i am a massive marvel fan. have seen every single marvel cinematic universe film release ever since it all really kicked off with the first iron man back in 2008 (the mind boggles this was over 10 years ago). i had very high expectations going into this film and i was not disappointed. the amount of humour moments was a surprise but very welcome. the action (especially the massive battle between thanos army and the returning heroes) was truly grandiose. the moment the heores all return starting with black panther was just very very cool! (look who isnt so smug now). \\n\\nsorry any black widow fans but the really standout emotional moment of the film for me had to be tony stark\\'s fittingly heroic exit. (it was right he is the one who finally outsmarts thanos - played brilliantly by josh brolin across both films). \\n\\nrobert downey jr had played iron man so well in so many of the films prior to this it was always going to be really hard to say goodbye to his character. captain america steve rodgers passing on the mantle was also fitting - finally taking iron man advice (if you\\'ve seen the film you\\'ll know what i mean). \\n\\nthe big battle for me topped the wakanda battle of the last film. it would so good that much more of the heroes got a chance to shine.\\n\\ni have to also say a very emotional film. i can hear your comments already - come on your having a laugh it\\'s a film about superheroes. this film was steeped in emotion - everyone can relate to love and loss. by the directors showing our heroes in a very human way, showing there vulnerabilities as well there strengths as heores it gave the film much gravitas. extremely fitting for a story that been developed for over 10 years. i would go as far as to say this film is should go down as a landmark in films history and it deserves to make mega amounts of money which is absolutely guaranteed. i will be going to see it again - a second viewing is a must i think. \\n\\n i don\\'t know if the films will be as good going forward if indeed brie larson\\'s captain marvel becomes the new focial point going forward. absolutely nothing against strong female lead roles. i like who they\\'re got to play the part. however the character seems almost too powerful - taking out another warship single handedly. why would she need the avengers help?\\n\\nthe message to all film fans - go see this film then go see it again!!!!!! absolutely the most satisfying film i have seen at the cinema in a long while ( i go to the cinema a lot).\\nthis movie is one of the best i\\'ve ever seen. to see all 23 movies (i believe) combined into one with the perfect amount of focus on each character was honestly unbelievable and i don\\'t know how they managed to create such a good film. my favourite part by far was the battle scene where all the women teamed up and fought, it was honestly so incredibly empowering and it reminded me about what the avengers were truly about, fighting injustice and encouraging empowerment whether that be in the other heroes or even in regular citizens who have been affected by the snap. i also want to add that they covered the vanish of 4 billion or-so people so well, to see the city of san francisco majority abandoned with the empty citi bank stadium and cars strewn and deteriorated after 5 years really set the mood for the direness of the situation and how depressing it was for the people who survived the snap. you need to see this movie!\\n\\nthere was an idea… to bring together a group of remarkable people… to see if we could become something more… so when they needed us… we could fight the battles… that they never could… it was called ‘the avengers initiative’… it was a statement, a promise, that if we could not protect the world… be damn sure we would avenge it… \\n# the following are my personal views and feelings regarding avengers : endgame which i have tried to keep as spoiler free as possible #\\nin 2008, we all embarked on a journey of fantasy and adventure that would redefine the ‘super-hero movie’ genre, build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by maestros like stan lee, and would culminate to provide what we now know as ‘the infinity saga’ of the marvel cinematic universe.\\nafter the devastating snap called ‘decimation’ that thanos did in avengers : infinity war, half the life in the universe is turned to dust, the world is in shackles, and our heroes are left defeated and devastated. but as it’s suggest, some people move on… but not them! thus, the avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen. will they succeed? that’s what this movie is about. \\n‘avengers : endgame’ is an epic, marvelous, emotional, and hard yet heart-warming conclusion to the infinity saga. the credit of making this mind blowing film goes to the makers of the film (directors - anthony and joe russo, writers - christopher markus and stephen mcfeely, producer – kevin feige, cinematographer – trent opaloch, and editors – jeffery ford and matthew schmidt), the actors (robert downey jr., chris evans, chris hemsworth, mark ruffalo, scarlett johansson, jeremy renner, don cheadle, paul rudd, bradley cooper, karen gillan, bradley cooper, dana gurira, and brie larson), and the music composer – alan sylvestri, stan lee and jack kirby, and to all the other cast and crew who have been working in the mcu films since 2008. a well written and crisp script, a very well crafted character development, bonds and relations between those characters, the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics, action, and science fiction stuff! there is a well maintained balance between action and emotion. the movie provides an emotional roller-coaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness, happiness, hope, surprise, apprehension, disbelief, shock, humor, and keeps you on the edge. you laugh heartily, applaud with enthusiasm, and also sob in sorrow. it’s also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments. \\nfinally when the  move ends, what you get is a satisfying, and poetic conclusion to the journey which began 11 years ago.\\navengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever made. yes, i enjoyed endgame more than infinity war, into the spider verse, batman begins, and dark knight rises. even though movies like infinity war had more action and more battles between the heroes and the villains, endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel boring but also doesn\\'t overload you with endless action sequences without focusing on a coherent story. it was the perfect follow up to the events at the end of infinity war where for the first time the heroes do not win. while i find the concept of time travel and parallel universes presented within endgame to be complicated and a bit confusing at times, (and yes i know that according to the comics that infinity stones only work within their own dimension, and thus taking an infinity stone from one universe will not make it work in another universe), i really enjoyed how the whole time travel heist allowed each of our main characters to reconnect with their family/relatives who have passed away. thor reconnects with his mother. ironman meets his father. captain america meets his former girlfriend from ww2. and on top of all that, we get to see how each one of these characters have evolved compared to how they were at the start of the mcu. captain america would have used brute force to achieve his goals in 2012-2014 but the 2023 captain america would now use non-violent and more clever means of achieving the same goal(s). one thing i didn\\'t like about the movie was how they killed off thanos early on only to bring back an earlier version of thanos for the final battle. to be honest, i actually liked the infinity war thanos more as a villain as he was more relatable and had clear goals whereas the endgame thanos was more of a brute force generic villain who just wanted to kill whoever he can get his hands on. but regardless, josh brolin played the role so well that most people just remember him as thanos and endgame was no exception. i\\'ll give this film a 9.5/10\\nhonestly i could not be happier with the outcomes of this movie, now sorry for saying this but this review will contain spoilers. seeing some of my favourite mcu characters come to an end including thanos was a real depressing moment, and left me and everyone feeling a bit unfilled, not because the movie didnt exceed expectations.....its because the movie left of with nothing regarding the future of the mcu. yes thor is seen with the guardians of the galaxy, but we knew that the guardians have an upcoming sequel and to be honest, the avengers are the pinacle of hype and excitment towards the mcu, and with 3 of the 6 \"og\" avengers actually dying them being iron man \"tony stark\",captain america\"steve rogers\" and black widow \"natasha romenoff\" it left the audience feeling sustained but still hungry for some more footage or any grasp of seeing the main avengers. we still do have many more movies regarding other characters such as spiderman, black panther and guardians of the galaxy but i still will never be even close to excited and hyped to see those movies as much as avengers endgame. i also wanted to complement the screentime of alot of our characters, the russo brothers did this so perfectly and i believe that they should be in charge of alot more of the future of the marvel cinematic universe. regarding other hated/less loved characters such as captain marvel and doctor strange, im glad they didnt give much screentime because i dont think anyone genuinlly likes seeing these guys hog up any of the 3 hours that the movie was and im happy to see that her power wasnt enough to even fuss thanos. overall i would give this movie a 10/10, its excellent and well blended together and every moment of the 3 hours that i watched the movie was just so amazing,not to mention the pure atmosphere of the cinema at the time was just so heartwarming, and i thank everyone that has ever been involved with the mcu for making a brilliant and interesting franchise that has made peoples childhood such a memorable phenomenom. stan lee you are an amazing and creative man, you\\'ll be remembered as such a legend and i hope every moment of your life was as amazing as you made mine when i watched the ending to the worlds most beloved franchise r.i.p.\\n\\ni grew up with these superheroes. iron man seemed like such a foreign and interesting concept as a superhero, with me only knowing of dynamic heroes like superman. \\n\\nand as a girl, i never thought i would be interested in this kind of stuff, that i would be captivated by such a intricate and action packed world. but the marvel cinematic universe is for all ages, and both genders. \\n\\ni\\'ve never loved characters this much before. i\\'ve never anticipated a movie as much as this one. i\\'ve never cried so much in a movie. (a good idea to bring my spiderman tissues into the theater, i tell you.)\\n\\nit enraptures you and makes you want more, but still remain satisfied with the ending. captain america is my favorite avenger, and the ending he got was more than i could ever ask for. \\n\\nthis whole movie was more than i could ever ask for. it was humorous, unpredictable, tear jerking. and grasping your sister\\'s arm because you\\'re so tense. \\n\\nthis may be the end to a decade of story telling, but i will forever be able to say that i saw avengers: endgame in theaters. i will be able to say that i watched this story weave together into a phenomenal finale. \\n\\nso i thank the russo brothers, and every single actor that starred in this movie. i am forever grateful to you for giving me the best childhood i could ever ask for. i fell in love with some of the most amazing fictional characters in any universe. \\n\\nno other movie can top this one, and i am totally okay with that.\\nit was pretty boring at least for the first half. there was a lot of catch up for the course of the 5 years that had passed but it was more than was needed to move the story forward.\\nit was too easy to kill thanos. i realize that killing him was an integral part of the storyline but once they found it, it was over in seconds. kind of anti-climactic. i know that was the point but that part of the story fell really flat.\\nthey made a mockery of thor. yes, i know it was for comic relief but the joke carried on way too long. thor didn’t seem dark and depressed. he seemed lazy. i think they could have lightened things up without making him such a joke.\\nant-man was an idiot. they did this in ant-man and the wasp and i had the same complaint. if anyone recalls from the original movie, scott lang was an electrical engineer who probably knows enough to base his understanding of time travel on something other than back to the future.\\nsince when is pepper the ironwoman? when the avengers assembled (that was actually a fun moment), was anyone else surprised to see her show up to do battle?\\nwhy was captain marvel there? she shows up (and not in the manner we see in the trailers) to save tony stark and help find thanos. once he’s dead, she says kthxbye because she has other planets to save in the universe. when she does reappear, she fists her way through thanos’ spaceship and yet somehow just can’t seem to get a good punch in.\\nwhy was it so easy for thanos to do the snap in the first place? maybe i just don’t understand the power of the infinity stones but he didn’t seem to have any trouble wielding the power but hulk could barely handle it and, well, we know what happened to tony.\\nwhy couldn’t anyone kill thanos? in infinity war, he was powerful because he has so many of the stones. in endgame, he’s just a bad guy and a warrior. arguably, he was never a power-hungry bad guy. he was focused on achieving balance in the universe. so the version of the thanos from the past didn’t quite work for me. with all of them and one of him (without any infinity stones), it seems like he could have been defeated.'"

       "'jesus christ! not only does this film reach our expectations as a film, it surpasses them. there are quite a few things i like about this film so this review may take a while to read.\\n\\nfirstly, the russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the mcu and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomely-handled pivotal moments in the film’s plot. it seems that many of the mcu’s best films are directed by anthony and joe russo and that doesn’t surprise me one bit.\\n\\ncompared to many mcu films, the acting in this film is phenomenal. everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature. shout out to jeremy renner, who portrays clint barton/hawkeye who’s character really developed into something new and better in this film and i’m looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments.\\n\\nalan silvestri is a master of musical score in media. in both endgame and infinity war his music adds so much tension to nearly every scene that it appears in. i honestly feel that with his involvement in the mcu, silvestri has propelled himself to be one of the great film composers with individuals like hans zimmer and john williams.\\n\\nthe action in this film is perfectly balanced with the more down-to-earth scenes in the film, which i’ll get into later. the climatic battle, in particular, is a masterpiece to behold. every character in that scene just the amount of screen time they deserve. no one gets too much or too little, in my opinion and this scene should be enough to impress any comic-book fan.\\n\\nthe visuals, as is the case with much of the mcu, is flawless. the attention to detail in such characters as thanos or rocket is beautiful and nearly every bit of cgi we get in these films is a bonafide work of art.\\n\\nfinally, the emotional weight in this film is truly stronger than that of any other mcu film by far. it’s unbelievable how it could top infinity war. the opening scene is pretty well done in the sense that it was genius to make the first scene spectacular.\\n\\noverall, i’m so happy that the finale to a 22-film story is this film. this film will probably be considered a classic in around a decade’s time. this film never fails to disappoint. anyone who doesn’t enjoy this film, well, let’s just say that they cannot be called a fan of the mcu.\\n\\ni loved the movie a lot \\nas i am great fan of marvel\\navengers: endgame\\', which marks the end of the infinity saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. the last film of the \\'avengers\\' franchise is remarkable and doesn\\'t disappoint. watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released \\'iron man\\'. i\\'m damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. the directors, anthony and joe russo, have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. the film has a great balance of humour, emotions and action. the biggest strength of the film is the emotions. this is the most emotional superhero film i have ever seen. it\\'s just perfect. the action sequences were jaw-dropping. the climatic battle left me amazed. it\\'s just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. the visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. the humour doesn\\'t look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. the plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. the film features many cameos of characters from the previous mcu films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. the background score gives me goosebumps, though i\\'ve listened to it several times. it was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the hulk. i enjoyed that a lot. but the show-stealer is robert downey jr, who plays the role of tony stark/iron man. the man who started it all proves yet again that there\\'s no one else who can perfect his role. do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.\\n\\nthoroughly wrapped up with incredible action, excitement, wow’moments and humor — avengers: endgame delivers on it\\'s promise by providing a truly epic conclusion (in the grandest fashion possible!) to 11 years of marvel cinematic universe awesomeness. this one, indeed felt like an emotional roller-coaster ride, and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved. the russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really, really high with their final installment. despite the longsome 3hr length, the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that it\\'s quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second. this is probably one of the most emotional films i\\'ve ever come across (surprisingly!), with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close. endgame faithfully shines in every department, while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale.\\navengers endgame is the sequel for the popular  the avengers (2015) and is the 22nd in the  marvel cinematic universe (mcu). action starts from where avengers-infinity war ended. the remaining avengers after half of all life in the universe was eliminated due to the actions of thanos (jos brolin), try to reunite. when everything looked lost, scott lang,aka ant man (paul rudd) re-energise the avengers.  iron man (robert downey jr.), thor (chris hemsworth), captain america (chris evans), black widow (scarlett johansson), the hulk (mark ruffalo), rocket (bradley cooper), nebula (karen gillan), hawkeye (jeremy renner) and ant man join hands once again to launch a final assault. to findout what happens next, enjoy avengers-end game on the silver screen. \\n\\nstar shine \\n\\nall the characters being super heroes, thrill viewers with their performances and actions. robert donwey and scarlett johansson standout with their perforamnces. this part had more focus on chris evans’s captain america, chris hemsworth’s thor, robert downey jr.’s iron man and scarlett johansson’s black widow. at times even mark ruffalo and jeremy renner along with paul rudd\\'s ant man get importance. \\n\\ndirector\\'s special \\n\\ndirector anthony russo,joe russo included all elements to attract all sections of movie lovers though mostly avengers has fan following among children across the world. apart from the high voltage action associated with avengers, it also showed the emotional exploration of love and loss, honor, family , friendship, and duty. \\n\\nthe story highlighted how one should conduct and deal in with different situations. there is little humor too and the unexpected twists and turns will thrill movie lovers. though it is tedious to sit through more than three hours without a break, the emotional journey associated with avengers by viewers for over the years, make them enjoy each and every scene. \\n\\nviewers can appreciate the way director highlighted the coureage,perservance and teamwork but nothing seems realistic when one analyses the between hand-to-hand combat vs. catastrophic, buildings-collapsing type of explosions and also the value of single death which upsets rather than the death of the crowds. \\n\\nstory,screenplay and direction though at times hit the roadblocks and one cannot come to terms with the illogical and unbelievable scenes, overall it is a treat to movie lovers across the world. \\n\\nviewers cannot make head or tail if they are unaware of avengers and so they should atleast watch mcus previous instalments infinity war and captain america: civil war to follow the plot. \\n\\n\\ntechnical\\n\\ntechnical and production values are grand. trent opaloch cinematography is beautiful and elevated the film to another level with his camera work. the camera angles are excellent creating powerful impact. \\n\\nalan silvestri\\'s background score is thumping and made a lasting impression. the background score haunts viewers even after they leave the theatres. \\n\\nediting of jeffrey ford,matthew schmidt is good and crispy. however there are few scenes in the film wich dragged the pace of the film testing the patience of the viewers. \\n\\nproduction values are grand. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nfinal take\\n\\navengers gives an amazing and emotional farewell.\\nnothing like the epic marvel infinity saga has ever been attempted in film history, and while it was nearly impossible to pull off a satisfying conclusion which hits nearly every note, endgame manages that daunting task. \\nthe at times wrenching emotional impact, the at times laugh-out-loud-funny humor, the at times dizzying action all contribute to the success of this spectacular and ultimately cathartic denouement. \\nyes there are plot holes and yes it is as ever difficult to track the many infinity macguffins, their history, powers and location in space and time, and yes in the end it doesn\\'t matter.\\nminor complaint #1 - after the huge build-up captain marvel\\'s role could have been more featured, her astonishing powers put to more prominent use, but this is ultimately the avengers story, the balance of hers yet to be told.\\nminor complaint #2 - a lot of screen time is spent explaining plot details and the often baffling intricacy of their plans, leaving less room, with the notable exceptions of tony stark and steve rogers, for the usual solid character development which is at the heart of each of these films.\\nas an all-too grown man raised on a steady diet of intelligently written, brilliantly drawn comic books about articulate, very human, heroes with extraordinary powers engaged in fantastic tales, it\\'s one of the great satisfactions of my adulthood to see these characters brought to vivid life through the astonishing power of film technology, which has made anything possible.\\ni look forward to what\\'s next - marvel is in good hands.\\nwas this review helpful to you?\\ni know i said no more surprises, but... i was really hoping to pull off one last one.”\\n\\nafter the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘infinity war’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done.\\n\\nwe’re in the endgame now.\\n\\n‘avengers: endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. for a movie that’s three hours long, not once did i feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). there\\'s so much going on. the fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. it all began when a cocky billionaire escaped a cave with a box of scraps, becoming iron man. then we followed the powerful but arrogant god who has to learn to be worthy of being named “the god of thunder”. and finally the first avenger, a man lost in time, but holds his pride strong in good nature.\\n\\nfrom start till finish i hooked, especially the opening scene which i knew what was coming, but wasn’t expecting the devastation.\\n\\nthe russo brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and i mean every character. i think black widow is best handled whenever the russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. i’m also thrilled hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps jeremy renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times.\\n\\nsame thing with paul rudd as scott lang/ant-man. it’s incredibly transparent that the russo brothers really like this character and doesn\\'t dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. they understand his intelligent and used scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. he basically saves the world (besides the rat).\\n\\nheck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even thor, which i don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. while still having a comedic charm from ‘thor: ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. he really is the strongest and most tragic avenger. the other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs.\\n\\nalso the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. robert downey jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. chris evans really grew into the role of captain america and i can\\'t imagine any other actor playing the part than him. karen gillan is often overlooked playing nebula, as i always thought she nails every role she plays. despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. what\\'s more to say about these actors than best casting ever.\\n\\nthe mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “infinity war” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. josh brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. thanos is this generation’s darth vader.\\n\\nthe action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘infinity war’. if i have to be honest, i shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but i was never bored during the more slow paced moments\\nthe entire mcu timeline consisting of 22 movies led up to this once-in-a-lifetime event. avengers endgame blew me away, as i am a huge fan of the marvel franchise. if you thought that infinity war  was the one to watch, you\\'ll think differently after watching endgame.\\n\\nthe russo brothers continue to amaze!!\\nthank god these two direct the movies because everything they add to them, makes every movie worthwhile. the suspense is phenomenal!\\n\\nthrilling and jaw-dropping to watch!\\n\\nthe tremendous cliffhanger at the end of infinity war left fans tense to found out what happens next. a year later we\\'re in the endgame, and oh my wasn\\'t it worth the wait.\\n\\nthe sequence the movie entailed was amazing, including how they introduced captain marvel in the post-credit scene of her debut movie a month before.\\n\\nalso, i give thanks to the russo brothers yet again for displaying a congratulative conclusion to an unforgettable journey through the saga. this latest movie is light years greater than infinity war because one movie after another advances and advances, which is the most stunning thing in a franchise you have spent your entire life waiting for.\\n\\nthe mad titan, thanos, doesn\\'t appear in many scenes as infinity war, but his gladiatorial brawl and unquestionable strength makes up for that as he can no doubt take on the avengers with or without the gauntlet. josh brolin is the perfect actor for the role, nobody could\\'ve done a better job at portraying the character as he did.\\n\\nthe masses of avengers hoping to defeat thanos make an unmisstakeable team in this movie, as they all come together at the end to hopefully complete their conquest and override thanos. the actors and actresses that mimick these superheroes give the movies added entertainment on-set and off-set, as they do their best to fit the characteristics and personality of the characters in stan lee\\'s comics.\\n\\navengers endgame is the fourth installment to the avengers movies and it sure is the one to watch because everything you see in the other three as well as the stand alone solo movies sequence together to show the characters backstories individually and they ultimately form the team of earth\\'s mightiest heroes in the movies that feature all of them as one unstoppable force.\\n\\ni give credit to the founder of marvel studios, stan lee, as he was the one who invented the comics and portrayed them in the timeline of events leading to avengers endgame as the conclusion to an unmissable chain of events in the marvel cinematic universe.\\n** spoilers alert *** avengers: endgame in one word simply fantastic!!!!!!!!!!. i am a massive marvel fan. have seen every single marvel cinematic universe film release ever since it all really kicked off with the first iron man back in 2008 (the mind boggles this was over 10 years ago). i had very high expectations going into this film and i was not disappointed. the amount of humour moments was a surprise but very welcome. the action (especially the massive battle between thanos army and the returning heroes) was truly grandiose. the moment the heores all return starting with black panther was just very very cool! (look who isnt so smug now). \\n\\nsorry any black widow fans but the really standout emotional moment of the film for me had to be tony stark\\'s fittingly heroic exit. (it was right he is the one who finally outsmarts thanos - played brilliantly by josh brolin across both films). \\n\\nrobert downey jr had played iron man so well in so many of the films prior to this it was always going to be really hard to say goodbye to his character. captain america steve rodgers passing on the mantle was also fitting - finally taking iron man advice (if you\\'ve seen the film you\\'ll know what i mean). \\n\\nthe big battle for me topped the wakanda battle of the last film. it would so good that much more of the heroes got a chance to shine.\\n\\ni have to also say a very emotional film. i can hear your comments already - come on your having a laugh it\\'s a film about superheroes. this film was steeped in emotion - everyone can relate to love and loss. by the directors showing our heroes in a very human way, showing there vulnerabilities as well there strengths as heores it gave the film much gravitas. extremely fitting for a story that been developed for over 10 years. i would go as far as to say this film is should go down as a landmark in films history and it deserves to make mega amounts of money which is absolutely guaranteed. i will be going to see it again - a second viewing is a must i think. \\n\\n i don\\'t know if the films will be as good going forward if indeed brie larson\\'s captain marvel becomes the new focial point going forward. absolutely nothing against strong female lead roles. i like who they\\'re got to play the part. however the character seems almost too powerful - taking out another warship single handedly. why would she need the avengers help?\\n\\nthe message to all film fans - go see this film then go see it again!!!!!! absolutely the most satisfying film i have seen at the cinema in a long while ( i go to the cinema a lot).\\nthis movie is one of the best i\\'ve ever seen. to see all 23 movies (i believe) combined into one with the perfect amount of focus on each character was honestly unbelievable and i don\\'t know how they managed to create such a good film. my favourite part by far was the battle scene where all the women teamed up and fought, it was honestly so incredibly empowering and it reminded me about what the avengers were truly about, fighting injustice and encouraging empowerment whether that be in the other heroes or even in regular citizens who have been affected by the snap. i also want to add that they covered the vanish of 4 billion or-so people so well, to see the city of san francisco majority abandoned with the empty citi bank stadium and cars strewn and deteriorated after 5 years really set the mood for the direness of the situation and how depressing it was for the people who survived the snap. you need to see this movie!\\n\\nthere was an idea… to bring together a group of remarkable people… to see if we could become something more… so when they needed us… we could fight the battles… that they never could… it was called ‘the avengers initiative’… it was a statement, a promise, that if we could not protect the world… be damn sure we would avenge it… \\n# the following are my personal views and feelings regarding avengers : endgame which i have tried to keep as spoiler free as possible #\\nin 2008, we all embarked on a journey of fantasy and adventure that would redefine the ‘super-hero movie’ genre, build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by maestros like stan lee, and would culminate to provide what we now know as ‘the infinity saga’ of the marvel cinematic universe.\\nafter the devastating snap called ‘decimation’ that thanos did in avengers : infinity war, half the life in the universe is turned to dust, the world is in shackles, and our heroes are left defeated and devastated. but as it’s suggest, some people move on… but not them! thus, the avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen. will they succeed? that’s what this movie is about. \\n‘avengers : endgame’ is an epic, marvelous, emotional, and hard yet heart-warming conclusion to the infinity saga. the credit of making this mind blowing film goes to the makers of the film (directors - anthony and joe russo, writers - christopher markus and stephen mcfeely, producer – kevin feige, cinematographer – trent opaloch, and editors – jeffery ford and matthew schmidt), the actors (robert downey jr., chris evans, chris hemsworth, mark ruffalo, scarlett johansson, jeremy renner, don cheadle, paul rudd, bradley cooper, karen gillan, bradley cooper, dana gurira, and brie larson), and the music composer – alan sylvestri, stan lee and jack kirby, and to all the other cast and crew who have been working in the mcu films since 2008. a well written and crisp script, a very well crafted character development, bonds and relations between those characters, the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics, action, and science fiction stuff! there is a well maintained balance between action and emotion. the movie provides an emotional roller-coaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness, happiness, hope, surprise, apprehension, disbelief, shock, humor, and keeps you on the edge. you laugh heartily, applaud with enthusiasm, and also sob in sorrow. it’s also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments. \\nfinally when the  move ends, what you get is a satisfying, and poetic conclusion to the journey which began 11 years ago.\\navengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever made. yes, i enjoyed endgame more than infinity war, into the spider verse, batman begins, and dark knight rises. even though movies like infinity war had more action and more battles between the heroes and the villains, endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel boring but also doesn\\'t overload you with endless action sequences without focusing on a coherent story. it was the perfect follow up to the events at the end of infinity war where for the first time the heroes do not win. while i find the concept of time travel and parallel universes presented within endgame to be complicated and a bit confusing at times, (and yes i know that according to the comics that infinity stones only work within their own dimension, and thus taking an infinity stone from one universe will not make it work in another universe), i really enjoyed how the whole time travel heist allowed each of our main characters to reconnect with their family/relatives who have passed away. thor reconnects with his mother. ironman meets his father. captain america meets his former girlfriend from ww2. and on top of all that, we get to see how each one of these characters have evolved compared to how they were at the start of the mcu. captain america would have used brute force to achieve his goals in 2012-2014 but the 2023 captain america would now use non-violent and more clever means of achieving the same goal(s). one thing i didn\\'t like about the movie was how they killed off thanos early on only to bring back an earlier version of thanos for the final battle. to be honest, i actually liked the infinity war thanos more as a villain as he was more relatable and had clear goals whereas the endgame thanos was more of a brute force generic villain who just wanted to kill whoever he can get his hands on. but regardless, josh brolin played the role so well that most people just remember him as thanos and endgame was no exception. i\\'ll give this film a 9.5/10\\nhonestly i could not be happier with the outcomes of this movie, now sorry for saying this but this review will contain spoilers. seeing some of my favourite mcu characters come to an end including thanos was a real depressing moment, and left me and everyone feeling a bit unfilled, not because the movie didnt exceed expectations.....its because the movie left of with nothing regarding the future of the mcu. yes thor is seen with the guardians of the galaxy, but we knew that the guardians have an upcoming sequel and to be honest, the avengers are the pinacle of hype and excitment towards the mcu, and with 3 of the 6 \"og\" avengers actually dying them being iron man \"tony stark\",captain america\"steve rogers\" and black widow \"natasha romenoff\" it left the audience feeling sustained but still hungry for some more footage or any grasp of seeing the main avengers. we still do have many more movies regarding other characters such as spiderman, black panther and guardians of the galaxy but i still will never be even close to excited and hyped to see those movies as much as avengers endgame. i also wanted to complement the screentime of alot of our characters, the russo brothers did this so perfectly and i believe that they should be in charge of alot more of the future of the marvel cinematic universe. regarding other hated/less loved characters such as captain marvel and doctor strange, im glad they didnt give much screentime because i dont think anyone genuinlly likes seeing these guys hog up any of the 3 hours that the movie was and im happy to see that her power wasnt enough to even fuss thanos. overall i would give this movie a 10/10, its excellent and well blended together and every moment of the 3 hours that i watched the movie was just so amazing,not to mention the pure atmosphere of the cinema at the time was just so heartwarming, and i thank everyone that has ever been involved with the mcu for making a brilliant and interesting franchise that has made peoples childhood such a memorable phenomenom. stan lee you are an amazing and creative man, you\\'ll be remembered as such a legend and i hope every moment of your life was as amazing as you made mine when i watched the ending to the worlds most beloved franchise r.i.p.\\n\\ni grew up with these superheroes. iron man seemed like such a foreign and interesting concept as a superhero, with me only knowing of dynamic heroes like superman. \\n\\nand as a girl, i never thought i would be interested in this kind of stuff, that i would be captivated by such a intricate and action packed world. but the marvel cinematic universe is for all ages, and both genders. \\n\\ni\\'ve never loved characters this much before. i\\'ve never anticipated a movie as much as this one. i\\'ve never cried so much in a movie. (a good idea to bring my spiderman tissues into the theater, i tell you.)\\n\\nit enraptures you and makes you want more, but still remain satisfied with the ending. captain america is my favorite avenger, and the ending he got was more than i could ever ask for. \\n\\nthis whole movie was more than i could ever ask for. it was humorous, unpredictable, tear jerking. and grasping your sister\\'s arm because you\\'re so tense. \\n\\nthis may be the end to a decade of story telling, but i will forever be able to say that i saw avengers: endgame in theaters. i will be able to say that i watched this story weave together into a phenomenal finale. \\n\\nso i thank the russo brothers, and every single actor that starred in this movie. i am forever grateful to you for giving me the best childhood i could ever ask for. i fell in love with some of the most amazing fictional characters in any universe. \\n\\nno other movie can top this one, and i am totally okay with that.\\nit was pretty boring at least for the first half. there was a lot of catch up for the course of the 5 years that had passed but it was more than was needed to move the story forward.\\nit was too easy to kill thanos. i realize that killing him was an integral part of the storyline but once they found it, it was over in seconds. kind of anti-climactic. i know that was the point but that part of the story fell really flat.\\nthey made a mockery of thor. yes, i know it was for comic relief but the joke carried on way too long. thor didn’t seem dark and depressed. he seemed lazy. i think they could have lightened things up without making him such a joke.\\nant-man was an idiot. they did this in ant-man and the wasp and i had the same complaint. if anyone recalls from the original movie, scott lang was an electrical engineer who probably knows enough to base his understanding of time travel on something other than back to the future.\\nsince when is pepper the ironwoman? when the avengers assembled (that was actually a fun moment), was anyone else surprised to see her show up to do battle?\\nwhy was captain marvel there? she shows up (and not in the manner we see in the trailers) to save tony stark and help find thanos. once he’s dead, she says kthxbye because she has other planets to save in the universe. when she does reappear, she fists her way through thanos’ spaceship and yet somehow just can’t seem to get a good punch in.\\nwhy was it so easy for thanos to do the snap in the first place? maybe i just don’t understand the power of the infinity stones but he didn’t seem to have any trouble wielding the power but hulk could barely handle it and, well, we know what happened to tony.\\nwhy couldn’t anyone kill thanos? in infinity war, he was powerful because he has so many of the stones. in endgame, he’s just a bad guy and a warrior. arguably, he was never a power-hungry bad guy. he was focused on achieving balance in the universe. so the version of the thanos from the past didn’t quite work for me. with all of them and one of him (without any infinity stones), it seems like he could have been defeated.'"

       "'jesus christ not only does this film reach our expectations as a film it surpasses them there are quite a few things i like about this film so this review may take a while to read\\n\\nfirstly the russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the mcu and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomelyhandled pivotal moments in the film’s plot it seems that many of the mcu’s best films are directed by anthony and joe russo and that doesn’t surprise me one bit\\n\\ncompared to many mcu films the acting in this film is phenomenal everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature shout out to jeremy renner who portrays clint bartonhawkeye who’s character really developed into something new and better in this film and i’m looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments\\n\\nalan silvestri is a master of musical score in media in both endgame and infinity war his music adds so much tension to nearly every scene that it appears in i honestly feel that with his involvement in the mcu silvestri has propelled himself to be one of the great film composers with individuals like hans zimmer and john williams\\n\\nthe action in this film is perfectly balanced with the more downtoearth scenes in the film which i’ll get into later the climatic battle in particular is a masterpiece to behold every character in that scene just the amount of screen time they deserve no one gets too much or too little in my opinion and this scene should be enough to impress any comicbook fan\\n\\nthe visuals as is the case with much of the mcu is flawless the attention to detail in such characters as thanos or rocket is beautiful and nearly every bit of cgi we get in these films is a bonafide work of art\\n\\nfinally the emotional weight in this film is truly stronger than that of any other mcu film by far it’s unbelievable how it could top infinity war the opening scene is pretty well done in the sense that it was genius to make the first scene spectacular\\n\\noverall i’m so happy that the finale to a 22film story is this film this film will probably be considered a classic in around a decade’s time this film never fails to disappoint anyone who doesn’t enjoy this film well let’s just say that they cannot be called a fan of the mcu\\n\\ni loved the movie a lot \\nas i am great fan of marvel\\navengers endgame which marks the end of the infinity saga is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience the last film of the avengers franchise is remarkable and doesnt disappoint watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released iron man im damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off the directors anthony and joe russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments the film has a great balance of humour emotions and action the biggest strength of the film is the emotions this is the most emotional superhero film i have ever seen its just perfect the action sequences were jawdropping the climatic battle left me amazed its just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words the visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film the humour doesnt look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film the plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful the film features many cameos of characters from the previous mcu films which just gives a double dose of excitement the background score gives me goosebumps though ive listened to it several times it was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the hulk i enjoyed that a lot but the showstealer is robert downey jr who plays the role of tony starkiron man the man who started it all proves yet again that theres no one else who can perfect his role do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle\\n\\nthoroughly wrapped up with incredible action excitement wow’moments and humor — avengers endgame delivers on its promise by providing a truly epic conclusion in the grandest fashion possible to 11 years of marvel cinematic universe awesomeness this one indeed felt like an emotional rollercoaster ride and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved the russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really really high with their final installment despite the longsome 3hr length the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that its quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second this is probably one of the most emotional films ive ever come across surprisingly with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close endgame faithfully shines in every department while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale\\navengers endgame is the sequel for the popular  the avengers 2015 and is the 22nd in the  marvel cinematic universe mcu action starts from where avengersinfinity war ended the remaining

associated with avengers it also showed the emotional exploration of love and loss honor family  friendship and duty \\n\\nthe story highlighted how one should conduct and deal in with different situations there is little humor too and the unexpected twists and turns will thrill movie lovers though it is tedious to sit through more than three hours without a break the emotional journey

put to more prominent use but this is ultimately the avengers story the balance of hers yet to be told\\nminor complaint 2  a lot of screen time is spent explaining plot details and the often baffling intricacy of their plans leaving less room with the notable exceptions of tony stark and steve rogers for the usual solid character development which is at the heart of each of these films\\nas an alltoo grown man raised on a steady diet of intelligently written brilliantly drawn comic books about articulate very human heroes with extraordinary powers engaged in fantastic tales its one of the great satisfactions of my adulthood to see these characters brought to vivid life through the astonishing power of film technology which has made anything possible\\ni look forward to whats next  marvel is in good hands\\nwas this review helpful to you\\ni know i said no more surprises but i was really hoping to pull off one last one”\\n\\nafter the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘infinity

that’s three hours long not once did i feel the length as everything flew by in my opinion theres so much going on the fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did it’s nothing short of a miracle it all began when a cocky billionaire escaped a cave with a box of scraps becoming iron man then we followed the powerful but arrogant god who has to learn to be worthy of being named “the god of thunder” and finally the first avenger a man lost in time but holds his pride strong in good nature\\n\\nfrom start till finish i hooked especially the opening scene which i knew what was coming but wasn’t expecting the devastation\\n\\nthe russo brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of

than hard as nails “girl power” trope  that no other director haven’t got the hint yet i’m also thrilled hawkeye gets his time to shine which helps jeremy renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times\\n\\nsame thing with paul rudd as scott langantman it’s incredibly transparent that the russo brothers really like this character and doesnt dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon they understand his intelligent and used scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage he basically saves the world besides the rat\\n\\nheck every character gets a great arc and yes even thor which i don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t while still having a comedic charm from ‘thor ragnarok’ but when the scene calls for him to be serious then expect chaos he really is the strongest and most tragic avenger the other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs\\n\\nalso the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar robert downey jr is magnificent as usual although here it hits home chris evans really grew into the role of captain america and i cant imagine any other actor playing the part than him karen gillan is often overlooked playing nebula as i always thought she nails every role she plays despite the heavy makeup she still can express so much whats more to say about these actors than best casting ever\\n\\nthe mad titan himself makes a return but doesn’t have much screen time than “infinity war” andwell let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction to say the last

studios stan lee as he was the one who invented the comics and portrayed them in the timeline of events leading to avengers endgame as the conclusion to an unmissable chain of events in the marvel cinematic universe\\n spoilers alert  avengers endgame in one word simply fantastic i am a massive marvel fan have seen every single marvel cinematic universe film release ever since it all really kicked off with the first iron man back in 2008 the mind boggles this was over 10 years ago i had very high expectations going into this film and i was not disappointed the amount of humour moments was a surprise but very welcome the action especially the massive battle between thanos army and the returning heroes was truly grandiose the moment the heores all return starting with black panther was just very very cool look who isnt so smug now \\n\\nsorry any black widow fans but the really standout emotional moment of the film for me had to be tony starks fittingly heroic exit it was right he is the one who finally outsmarts thanos  played brilliantly by josh brolin across both films \\n\\nrobert downey jr had played iron man so well in so many of the films prior to this it was always going to be really hard to say goodbye to his character captain america steve rodgers passing on the mantle was also fitting  finally taking iron man advice if youve seen the film youll know what i mean \\n\\nthe big battle for me topped the wakanda battle of the last film it would so good that much more of the heroes got a chance to shine\\n\\ni have to also say a very emotional film i can hear your comments already  come on your having a laugh its a film about superheroes this film was steeped in emotion  everyone can relate to love and loss by the directors showing our heroes in a very human way showing there vulnerabilities as well there strengths as heores it gave the film much gravitas extremely fitting for a story that been developed for over 10 years i would go as far as to say this film is should go down as a landmark in films history and it deserves to make mega amounts of money which is absolutely guaranteed i will be going to see it again  a second viewing is a must i think \\n\\n i dont know if the films will be as good going forward if indeed brie larsons captain marvel becomes the new focial point going forward absolutely nothing against strong female lead roles i like who theyre got to play the part however the character seems almost too powerful  taking out another warship single handedly why would she need the avengers help\\n\\nthe message to all film fans  go see this film then go see it again absolutely the most satisfying film i have seen at the cinema in a long while  i go to the cinema a lot\\nthis movie is one of the best ive ever seen to see all 23 movies i believe combined into one with the perfect amount of focus on each character was honestly unbelievable and i dont know how they managed to create such a good film my favourite part by far was the battle scene where all the women teamed up and fought it was honestly so incredibly empowering and it reminded me about what the avengers were truly about fighting injustice and encouraging empowerment whether that be in the other heroes or even in regular citizens who have been affected by the snap i also want to add that they covered the vanish of 4 billion orso people so well to see the city of san francisco majority abandoned with the empty citi bank stadium and cars strewn and deteriorated after 5 years really set the mood for the direness of the situation and how depressing it was for the people who survived the snap you need to see this movie\\n\\nthere was an idea… to bring together a group of remarkable people… to see if we could become something more… so when they needed us… we could fight the battles… that they never could… it was called ‘the avengers initiative’… it was a statement a promise that if we could not protect the world… be damn sure we would avenge it… \\n the following are my personal views and feelings regarding avengers  endgame which i have tried to keep as spoiler free as possible \\nin 2008 we all embarked on a journey of fantasy and adventure that would redefine the ‘superhero movie’ genre build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by maestros like stan lee and would culminate to provide what we now know as ‘the infinity saga’ of the marvel cinematic universe\\nafter the devastating snap called ‘decimation’ that thanos did in avengers  infinity war half the life in the universe is turned to dust the world is in shackles and our heroes are left defeated and devastated but as it’s suggest some people move on… but not them thus the avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen will they succeed that’s what this movie is about \\n‘avengers  endgame’ is an epic marvelous emotional and hard yet heartwarming conclusion to the infinity saga the credit of making this mind blowing film goes to the makers of the film directors  anthony and joe russo writers  christopher markus and stephen mcfeely producer – kevin feige cinematographer – trent opaloch and editors – jeffery ford and matthew schmidt the actors robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo scarlett johansson jeremy renner don cheadle paul rudd bradley cooper karen gillan bradley cooper dana gurira and brie larson and the music composer – alan sylvestri stan lee and jack kirby and to all the other cast and crew who have been working in the mcu films since 2008 a well written and crisp script a very well crafted character development bonds and relations between those characters the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics action and science fiction stuff there is a well maintained balance between action and emotion the movie provides an emotional rollercoaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness happiness hope surprise apprehension disbelief shock humor and keeps you on the edge you laugh heartily applaud with enthusiasm and also sob in sorrow it’s also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments \\nfinally when the  move ends what you get is a satisfying and poetic conclusion to the journey which began 11 years ago\\navengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever made yes i enjoyed endgame more than infinity war into the spider verse batman begins and dark knight rises even though movies like infinity war had more action and more battles between the heroes and the villains endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel boring but also doesnt overload you with endless action sequences without focusing on a coherent story it was the perfect follow up to the events at the end of infinity war where for the first time the heroes do not win while i find the concept of time travel and parallel universes presented within endgame to be complicated and a bit confusing at times and yes i know that according to the comics that infinity stones only work within their own dimension and thus taking an infinity stone from one universe will not make it work in another universe i really enjoyed how the whole time travel heist allowed each of our main characters to reconnect with their familyrelatives who have passed away thor reconnects with his mother ironman meets his father captain america meets his former girlfriend from ww2 and on top of all that we get to see how each one of these characters have evolved compared to how they were at the start of the mcu captain america would have used brute force to achieve his goals in 20122014 but the 2023 captain america would now use nonviolent and more clever means of achieving the same goals one thing i didnt like about the movie was how they killed off thanos early on only to bring back an earlier version of thanos for the final battle to be honest i actually liked the infinity war thanos more as a villain as he was more relatable and had clear goals whereas the endgame thanos was more of a brute force generic villain who just wanted to kill whoever he can get his hands on but regardless josh brolin played the role so well that most people just remember him as thanos and endgame was no exception ill give this film a 9510\\nhonestly i could not be happier with the outcomes of this movie now sorry for saying this but this review will contain spoilers seeing some of my favourite mcu characters come to an end including thanos was a real depressing moment and left me and everyone feeling a bit unfilled not because the movie didnt exceed expectationsits because the movie left of with nothing regarding the future of the mcu yes thor is seen with the guardians of the galaxy but we knew that the guardians have an upcoming sequel and to be honest the avengers are the pinacle of hype and excitment towards the mcu and with 3 of the 6 og avengers actually dying them being iron man tony starkcaptain americasteve rogers and black widow natasha romenoff it left the audience feeling sustained but still hungry for some more footage or any grasp of seeing the main avengers we still do have many more movies regarding other characters such as spiderman black panther and guardians of the galaxy but i still will never be even close to excited and hyped to see those movies as much as avengers endgame i also wanted to complement the screentime of alot of our characters the russo brothers did this so perfectly and i believe that they should be in charge of alot more of the future of the marvel cinematic universe regarding other hatedless loved characters such as captain marvel and doctor strange im glad they didnt give much screentime because i dont think anyone genuinlly likes seeing these guys hog up any of the 3 hours that the movie was and im happy to see that her power wasnt enough to even fuss thanos overall i would give this movie a 1010 its excellent and well blended together and every moment of the 3 hours that i watched the movie was just so amazingnot to mention the pure atmosphere of the cinema at the time was just so heartwarming and i thank everyone that has ever been involved with the mcu for making a brilliant and interesting franchise that has made peoples childhood such a memorable phenomenom stan lee you are an amazing and creative man youll be remembered as such a legend and i hope every moment of your life was as amazing as you made mine when i watched the ending to the worlds most beloved franchise rip\\n\\ni grew up with these superheroes iron man seemed like such a foreign and interesting concept as a superhero with me only knowing of dynamic heroes like superman \\n\\nand as a girl i never thought i would be interested in this kind of stuff that i would be captivated by such a intricate and action packed world but the marvel cinematic universe is for all ages and both genders \\n\\nive never loved characters this much before ive never anticipated a movie as much as this one ive never cried so much in a movie a good idea to bring my spiderman tissues into the theater i tell you\\n\\nit enraptures you and makes you want more but still remain satisfied with the ending captain america is my favorite avenger and the ending he got was more than i could ever ask for \\n\\nthis whole movie was more than i could ever ask for it was humorous unpredictable tear jerking and grasping your sisters arm because youre so tense \\n\\nthis may be the end to a decade of story telling but i will forever be able to say that i saw avengers endgame in theaters i will be able to say that i watched this story weave together into a phenomenal finale \\n\\nso i thank the russo brothers and every single actor that starred in this movie i am forever grateful to you for giving me the best childhood i could ever ask for i fell in love with some of the most amazing fictional characters in any universe \\n\\nno other movie can top this one and i am totally okay with that\\nit was pretty boring at least for the first half there was a lot of catch up for the course of the 5 years that had passed but it was more than was needed to move the story forward\\nit was too easy to kill thanos i realize that killing him was an integral part of the storyline but once they found it it was over in seconds kind of anticlimactic i know that was the point but that part of the story fell really flat\\nthey made a mockery of thor yes i know it was for comic relief but the joke carried on way too long thor didn’t seem dark and depressed he seemed lazy i think they could have lightened things up without making him such a joke\\nantman was an idiot they did this in antman and the wasp and i had the same complaint if anyone recalls from the original movie scott lang was an electrical engineer who probably knows enough to base his understanding of time travel on something other than back to the future\\nsince when is pepper the ironwoman when the avengers assembled that was actually a fun moment was anyone else surprised to see her show up to do battle\\nwhy was captain marvel there she shows up and not in the manner we see in the trailers to save tony stark and help find thanos once he’s dead she says kthxbye because she has other planets to save in the universe when she does reappear she fists her way through thanos’ spaceship and yet somehow just can’t seem to get a good punch in\\nwhy was it so easy for thanos to do the snap in the first place maybe i just don’t understand the power of the infinity stones but he didn’t seem to have any trouble wielding the power but hulk could barely handle it and well we know what happened to tony\\nwhy couldn’t anyone kill thanos in infinity war he was powerful because he has so many of the stones in endgame he’s just a bad guy and a warrior arguably he was never a powerhungry bad guy he was focused on achieving balance in the universe so the version of the thanos from the past didn’t quite work for me with all of them and one of him without any infinity stones it seems like he could have been defeated'"

       "'jesus christ not only does this film reach our expectations as a film it surpasses them there are quite a few things i like about this film so this review may take a while to read  firstly the russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the mcu and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomelyhandled pivotal moments in the film’s plot it seems that many of the mcu’s best films are directed by anthony and joe russo and that doesn’t surprise me one bit  compared to many mcu films the acting in this film is phenomenal everyone in the cast deeply cares for this film and you can tell that they all understand the significance of this feature shout out to jeremy renner who portrays clint bartonhawkeye who’s character really developed into something new and better in this film and i’m looking forward to seeing the character in future instalments  alan silvestri is a master of musical score in media in both endgame and infinity war his music adds so much tension to nearly every scene that it appears in i honestly feel that with his involvement in the mcu silvestri has propelled himself to be one of the great film composers with individuals like hans zimmer and john williams  the action in this film is perfectly balanced with the more downtoearth scenes in the film which i’ll get into later the climatic battle in particular is a masterpiece to behold every character in that scene just the amount of screen time they deserve no one gets too much or too little in my opinion and this scene should be enough to impress any comicbook fan  the visuals as is the case with much of the mcu is flawless the attention to detail in such characters as thanos or rocket is beautiful and nearly every bit of cgi we get in these films is a bonafide work of art  finally the emotional weight in this film is truly stronger than that of any other mcu film by far it’s unbelievable how it could top infinity war the opening scene is pretty well done in the sense that it was genius to make the first scene spectacular  overall i’m so happy that the finale to a 22film story is this film this film will probably be considered a classic in around a decade’s time this film never fails to disappoint anyone who doesn’t enjoy this film well let’s just say that they cannot be called a fan of the mcu  i loved the movie a lot  as i am great fan of marvel avengers endgame which marks the end of the infinity saga is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience the last film of the avengers franchise is remarkable and doesnt disappoint watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released iron man im damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off the directors anthony and joe russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience christopher markus and stephen mcfeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments the film has a great balance of humour emotions and action the biggest strength of the film is the emotions this is the most emotional superhero film i have ever seen its just perfect the action sequences were jawdropping the climatic battle left me amazed its just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words the visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film the humour doesnt look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film the plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful the film features many cameos of characters from the previous mcu films which just gives a double dose of excitement the background score gives me goosebumps though ive listened to it several times it was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the hulk i enjoyed that a lot but the showstealer is robert downey jr who plays the role of tony starkiron man the man who started it all proves yet again that theres no one else who can perfect his role do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle  thoroughly wrapped up with incredible action excitement wow’moments and humor — avengers endgame delivers on its promise by providing a truly epic conclusion in the grandest fashion possible to 11 years of marvel cinematic universe awesomeness this one indeed felt like an emotional rollercoaster ride and managed to stage a perfect farewell that our beloved superheroes deserved the russo brothers have genuinely redefined the art of classic comic book storytelling and set the standards really really high with their final installment despite the longsome 3hr length the film is sooooo much enjoyable all over that its quite impossible for anyone to get their eyes off the screen for even a split second this is probably one of the most emotional films ive ever come across surprisingly with tears in the corner of my eyes during the final moments and witnessing the whole crowd inside the theatre giving a standing ovation as it drew to a close endgame faithfully shines in every department while honoring the past in an incredibly satisfying finale avengers endgame is the sequel for the popular  the avengers 2015 and is the 22nd in the  marvel cinematic universe mcu action starts from where avengersinfinity war ended the remaining avengers after half of all life in the universe was eliminated due to the actions of thanos jos brolin try to reunite when everything looked lost scott langaka ant man paul rudd reenergise the avengers  iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans black widow scarlett johansson the hulk mark ruffalo rocket bradley cooper nebula karen gillan hawkeye jeremy renner and ant man join hands once again to launch a final assault to findout what happens next enjoy avengersend game on the silver screen   star shine   all the characters being super heroes thrill viewers with their performances and actions robert donwey and scarlett johansson standout with their perforamnces this part had more focus on chris evans’s captain america chris hemsworth’s thor robert downey jr’s iron man and scarlett johansson’s black widow at times even mark ruffalo and jeremy renner along with paul rudds ant man get importance   directors special   director anthony russojoe russo included all elements to attract all sections of movie lovers though mostly avengers has fan following among children across the world apart from the high voltage action associated with avengers it also showed the emotional exploration of love and loss honor family  friendship and duty   the story highlighted how one should conduct and deal in with different situations there is little humor too and the unexpected twists and turns will thrill movie lovers though it is tedious to sit through more than three hours without a break the emotional journey associated with avengers by viewers for over the years make them enjoy each and every scene   viewers can appreciate the way director highlighted the coureageperservance and teamwork but nothing seems realistic when one analyses the between handtohand combat vs catastrophic buildingscollapsing type of explosions and also the value of single death which upsets rather than the death of the crowds   storyscreenplay and direction though at times hit the roadblocks and one cannot come to terms with the illogical and unbelievable scenes overall it is a treat to movie lovers across the world   viewers cannot make head or tail if they are unaware of avengers and so they should atleast watch mcus previous instalments infinity war and captain america civil war to follow the plot    technical  technical and production values are grand trent opaloch cinematography is beautiful and elevated the film to another level with his camera work the camera angles are excellent creating powerful impact   alan silvestris background score is thumping and made a lasting impression the background score haunts viewers even after they leave the theatres   editing of jeffrey fordmatthew schmidt is good and crispy however there are few scenes in the film wich dragged the pace of the film testing the patience of the viewers   production values are grand       final take  avengers gives an amazing and emotional farewell nothing like the epic marvel infinity saga has ever been attempted in film history and while it was nearly impossible to pull off a satisfying conclusion which hits nearly every note endgame manages that daunting task  the at times wrenching emotional impact the at times laughoutloudfunny humor the at times dizzying action all contribute to the success of this spectacular and ultimately cathartic denouement  yes there are plot holes and yes it is as ever difficult to track the many infinity macguffins their history powers and location in space and time and yes in the end it doesnt matter minor complaint 1  after the huge buildup captain marvels role could have been more featured her astonishing powers put to more prominent use but this is ultimately the avengers story the balance of hers yet to be told minor complaint 2  a lot of screen time is spent explaining plot details and the often baffling intricacy of their plans leaving less room with the notable exceptions of tony stark and steve rogers for the usual solid character development which is at the heart of each of these films as an alltoo grown man raised on a steady diet of intelligently written brilliantly drawn comic books about articulate very human heroes with extraordinary powers engaged in fantastic tales its one of the great satisfactions of my adulthood to see these characters brought to vivid life through the astonishing power of film technology which has made anything possible i look forward to whats next  marvel is in good hands was this review helpful to you i know i said no more surprises but i was really hoping to pull off one last one”  after the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘infinity war’ the question that ran through our head’s was “hmmwhat just happened” heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done  we’re in the endgame now  ‘avengers endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale for a movie that’s three hours long not once did i feel the length as everything flew by in my opinion theres so much going on the fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did it’s nothing short of a miracle it all began when a cocky billionaire escaped a cave with a box of scraps becoming iron man then we followed the powerful but arrogant god who has to learn to be worthy of being named “the god of thunder” and finally the first avenger a man lost in time but holds his pride strong in good nature  from start till finish i hooked especially the opening scene which i knew what was coming but wasn’t expecting the devastation  the russo brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character and i mean every character i think black widow is best handled whenever the russo’s are involved in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope  that no other director haven’t got the hint yet i’m also thrilled hawkeye gets his time to shine which helps jeremy renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times  same thing with paul rudd as scott langantman it’s incredibly transparent that the russo brothers really like this character and doesnt dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon they understand his intelligent and used scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage he basically saves the world besides the rat  heck every character gets a great arc and yes even thor which i don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t while still having a comedic charm from ‘thor ragnarok’ but when the scene calls for him to be serious then expect chaos he really is the strongest and most tragic avenger the other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs  also the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar robert downey jr is magnificent as usual although here it hits home chris evans really grew into the role of captain america and i cant imagine any other actor playing the part than him karen gillan is often overlooked playing nebula as i always thought she nails every role she plays despite the heavy makeup she still can express so much whats more to say about these actors than best casting ever  the mad titan himself makes a return but doesn’t have much screen time than “infinity war” andwell let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction to say the last still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet josh brolin once again delivers an excellent performance thanos is this generation’s darth vader  the action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘infinity war’ if i have to be honest i shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout but i was never bored during the more slow paced moments the entire mcu timeline consisting of 22 movies led up to this onceinalifetime event avengers endgame blew me away as i am a huge fan of the marvel franchise if you thought that infinity war  was the one to watch youll think differently after watching endgame  the russo brothers continue to amaze thank god these two direct the movies because everything they add to them makes every movie worthwhile the suspense is phenomenal  thrilling and jawdropping to watch  the tremendous cliffhanger at the end of infinity war left fans tense to found out what happens next a year later were in the endgame and oh my wasnt it worth the wait  the sequence the movie entailed was amazing including how they introduced captain marvel in the postcredit scene of her debut movie a month before  also i give thanks to the russo brothers yet again for displaying a congratulative conclusion to an unforgettable journey through the saga this latest movie is light years greater than infinity war because one movie after another advances and advances which is the most stunning thing in a franchise you have spent your entire life waiting for  the mad titan thanos doesnt appear in many scenes as infinity war but his gladiatorial brawl and unquestionable strength makes up for that as he can no doubt take on the avengers with or without the gauntlet josh brolin is the perfect actor for the role nobody couldve done a better job at portraying the character as he did  the masses of avengers hoping to defeat thanos make an unmisstakeable team in this movie as they all come together at the end to hopefully complete their conquest and override thanos the actors and actresses that mimick these superheroes give the movies added entertainment onset and offset as they do their best to fit the characteristics and personality of the characters in stan lees comics  avengers endgame is the fourth installment to the avengers movies and it sure is the one to watch because everything you see in the other three as well as the stand alone solo movies sequence together to show the characters backstories individually and they ultimately form the team of earths mightiest heroes in the movies that feature all of them as one unstoppable force  i give credit to the founder of marvel studios stan lee as he was the one who invented the comics and portrayed them in the timeline of events leading to avengers endgame as the conclusion to an unmissable chain of events in the marvel

the ‘superhero movie’ genre build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by maestros like stan lee and would culminate to provide what we now know as ‘the infinity saga’ of the marvel cinematic universe after the devastating snap called ‘decimation’ that thanos did in avengers  infinity war half the life in the universe is turned to dust the world is in shackles and our heroes are left defeated and devastated but as it’s suggest some people move on… but not them thus the avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen will they succeed that’s what this movie is about  ‘avengers  endgame’ is an epic marvelous emotional and hard yet heartwarming conclusion to the infinity saga the credit of making this mind blowing film goes to the makers of the film directors  anthony and joe russo writers  christopher markus and stephen mcfeely producer – kevin feige cinematographer – trent opaloch and editors – jeffery ford and matthew schmidt the actors robert downey jr chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo scarlett johansson jeremy renner don cheadle paul rudd bradley cooper karen gillan bradley cooper dana gurira and brie larson and the music composer – alan sylvestri stan lee and jack kirby and to all the other cast and crew who have been working in the mcu films since 2008 a well written and crisp script a very well crafted character development bonds and relations between those characters the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics action and science fiction stuff there is a well maintained balance between action and emotion the movie provides an emotional rollercoaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness happiness hope surprise apprehension disbelief shock humor and keeps you on the edge you laugh heartily applaud with enthusiasm and also sob in sorrow it’s also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments  finally when the  move ends what you get is a satisfying and poetic conclusion to the journey which began 11 years ago avengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever made yes i enjoyed endgame more than infinity war into the spider verse batman begins and dark knight rises even though movies like infinity war had more action and more battles between the heroes and the villains endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel boring but also doesnt overload you with endless action sequences without focusing on a coherent story it was the perfect follow up to the events at the end of infinity war where for the first time the heroes do not win while i find the concept of time travel and parallel universes presented within endgame to be complicated and a bit confusing at times and yes i know that according to the comics that infinity stones only work within their own dimension and thus taking an infinity stone from one universe will not make it work in another universe i really enjoyed how the whole time travel heist allowed each of our main characters to reconnect with their familyrelatives who have passed away thor reconnects with his mother ironman meets his father captain america meets his former girlfriend from ww2 and on top of all that we get to see how each one of these characters have evolved compared to how they were at the start of the mcu captain america would have used brute force to achieve his goals in 20122014 but the 2023 captain america would now use nonviolent and more clever means of achieving the same goals one thing i didnt like about the movie was how they killed off thanos early on only to bring back an earlier version of thanos for the final battle to be honest i actually liked the infinity war thanos more as a villain as he was more relatable and had clear goals whereas the endgame thanos was more of a brute force generic villain who just wanted to kill whoever he can get his hands on but regardless josh brolin played the role so well that most people just remember him as thanos and endgame was no exception ill give this film a 9510 honestly i could not be happier with the outcomes of this movie now sorry for saying this but this review will contain spoilers seeing some of my favourite mcu characters come to an end including thanos was a real depressing moment and left me and everyone feeling a bit unfilled not because the movie didnt exceed expectationsits because the movie left of with nothing regarding the future of the mcu yes thor is seen with the guardians of the galaxy but we knew that the guardians have an upcoming sequel and to be honest the avengers are the pinacle of hype and excitment towards the mcu and with 3 of the 6 og avengers actually dying them being iron man tony starkcaptain americasteve rogers and black widow natasha romenoff it left the audience feeling sustained but still hungry for some more footage or any grasp of seeing the main avengers we still do have many more movies regarding other characters such as spiderman black panther and guardians of the galaxy but i still will never be even close to excited and hyped to see those movies as much as avengers endgame i also wanted to complement the screentime of alot of our characters the russo brothers did this so perfectly and i believe that they should be in charge of alot more of the future of the marvel cinematic universe regarding other hatedless loved characters such as captain marvel and doctor strange im glad they didnt give much screentime because i dont think anyone genuinlly likes seeing these guys hog up any of the 3 hours that the movie was and im happy to see that her power wasnt enough to even fuss thanos overall i would give this movie a 1010 its excellent and well blended together and every moment of the 3 hours that i watched the movie was just so amazingnot to mention the pure atmosphere of the cinema at the time was just so heartwarming and i thank everyone that has ever been involved with the mcu for making a brilliant and interesting franchise that has made peoples childhood such a memorable phenomenom stan lee you are an amazing and creative man youll be remembered as such a legend and i hope every moment of your life was as amazing as you made mine when i watched the ending to the worlds most beloved franchise rip  i grew up with these superheroes iron man seemed like such a foreign and interesting concept as a superhero with me only knowing of dynamic heroes like superman   and as a girl i never thought i would be interested in this kind of stuff that i would be captivated by such a intricate and action packed world but the marvel cinematic universe is for all ages and both genders   ive never loved characters this much before ive never anticipated a movie as much as this one ive never cried so much in a movie a good idea to bring my spiderman tissues into the theater i tell you  it enraptures you and makes you want more but still remain satisfied with the ending captain america is my favorite avenger and the ending he got was more than i could ever ask for   this whole movie was more than i could ever ask for it was humorous unpredictable tear jerking and grasping your sisters arm because youre so tense   this may be the end to a decade of story telling but i will forever be able to say that i saw avengers endgame in theaters i will be able to say that i watched this story weave together into a phenomenal finale   so i thank the russo brothers and every single actor that starred in this movie i am forever grateful to you for giving me the best childhood i could ever ask for i fell in love with some of the most amazing fictional characters in any universe   no other movie can top this one and i am totally okay with that it was pretty boring at least for the first half there was a lot of catch up for the course of the 5 years that had passed but it was more than was needed to move the story forward it was too easy to kill thanos i realize that killing him was an integral part of the storyline but once they found it it was over in seconds kind of anticlimactic i know that was the point but that part of the story fell really flat they made a mockery of thor yes i know it was for comic relief but the joke carried on way too long thor didn’t seem dark and depressed he seemed lazy i think they could have lightened things up without making him such a joke antman was an idiot they did this in antman and the wasp and i had the same complaint if anyone recalls from the original movie scott lang was an electrical engineer who probably knows enough to base his understanding of time travel on something other than back to the future since when is pepper the ironwoman when the avengers assembled that was actually a fun moment was anyone else surprised to see her show up to do battle why was captain marvel there she shows up and not in the manner we see in the trailers to save tony stark and help find thanos once he’s dead she says kthxbye because she has other planets to save in the universe when she does reappear she fists her way through thanos’ spaceship and yet somehow just can’t seem to get a good punch in why was it so easy for thanos to do the snap in the first place maybe i just don’t understand the power of the infinity stones but he didn’t seem to have any trouble wielding the power but hulk could barely handle it and well we know what happened to tony why couldn’t anyone kill thanos in infinity war he was powerful because he has so many of the stones in endgame he’s just a bad guy and a warrior arguably he was never a powerhungry bad guy he was focused on achieving balance in the universe so the version of the thanos from the past didn’t quite work for me with all of them and one of him without any infinity stones it seems like he could have been defeated'"
